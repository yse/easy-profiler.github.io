# Key features

- Extremely low overhead
- Low additional memory usage
- Cross-platform
- Profiling over network
- Capture thread context-switch events
- Store user variables (both single values and arrays)
- GUI could be connected to an application which is already profiling (so you can profile initialization of your application)
- Monitor main thread fps at real-time in GUI even if profiling is disabled or draw your own HUD/fps-plot directly in your application using data provided by profiler
- Save a snapshot (selected area) of profiled data from file
- Add bookmarks at any place on the timeline
- Configurable timer type with CMakeLists or preprocessor macros
